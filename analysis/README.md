About Olist ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·:

Olist is a leading e-commerce service that connects merchants to main marketplaces in Brazil. They provide a wide range of offers including inventory management, dealing with reviews and customer contacts to logistic services.

Olist charges sellers a monthly fee. This fee is progressive with the volume of orders.

Here are the seller and customer workflows:

**Seller:**

- Seller joins Olist
- Seller uploads products catalogue
- Seller gets notified when a product is sold
- Seller hands over an item to the logistic carrier

Note: that multiple sellers can be involved in one customer order!

**Customer:**

- Browses products on the marketplace
- Purchases products from Olist.store
- Gets an expected date for delivery
- Receives the order
- Leaves a review about the order

Note: A review can be left as soon as the order is sent, meaning that a customer can leave a review for a product he did not receive yet!

Before start, add `olist` path to `PYTHONPATH`.

This will allow you to easily import modules defined in `olist` in your notebooks.


The project is going to be divided in 3 steps:

-  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-  Statistical Inference
-  Conclusion and Potential Solutions

<h3 align="left">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h3>

-  Data cleaning and preprocessing
-  Descriptive statistics and summary metrics
-  Identifying key trends, patterns, and anomalies

<h3 align="left">Statistical Inference:</h3>

-  Investigate the orders and their associated review score.
-  Find sellers who have repeatedly been underperforming vs. others and understand why.
-  Find product categories that repeatedly underperform vs. others.

<h3 align="left">Conclusion and Potential Solutions:</h3>

-  How could Olist improve its profit?
-  Should Olist remove underperforming sellers from its marketplace?
